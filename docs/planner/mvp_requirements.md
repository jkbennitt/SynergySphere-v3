# Synergy Sphere MVP Requirements

> **Version 1.0** | **Minimum Viable Product Specification**

## üìã Document Information

- **Document Type**: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: January 27, 2025
- **Status**: Active
- **Owner**: Product Team
- **Review Cycle**: Monthly

## üìñ Overview

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Synergy Sphere is designed to showcase the core functionality of the platform while being straightforward to build and test. It focuses on two main modules: the Geoscope for data visualization and the World Game for interactive simulations. Additionally, it includes basic community features to encourage user engagement.

This MVP serves as a proof of concept, allowing us to validate the idea with real users and gather feedback for future development.

## Geoscope Module

- **Interactive Globe**: A basic 3D globe rendered with Three.js, allowing rotation and zoom.
- **Data Layer**: One data layer, such as CO2 emissions, visualized as colored regions or markers on the globe.
- **Interaction**: Users can rotate the globe and click on countries to view specific data details.

## World Game Module

- **Simulation**: A simplified model where users can adjust one parameter, such as the percentage of renewable energy usage.
- **Outcome**: The simulation calculates a basic outcome, like the projected global temperature change.
- **Visualization**: The outcome is displayed as a text output or a simple chart.

## Community Features

- **Sharing**: Users can save their simulation results and share them via a unique link.
- **Comments**: A basic comment section where users can discuss their results and ideas.

## User Journey

1. Users start on the homepage, where they see the interactive globe.
2. They can explore the data by rotating the globe and clicking on regions.
3. From the menu, they can switch to the simulation mode.
4. In simulation mode, they adjust the parameter and run the simulation.
5. They view the outcome and can choose to share it with the community.
6. In the community section, they can see others' results and engage in discussions.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Three.js for the globe.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and MongoDB.
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with JWT.
- **Deployment**: Replit for hosting and collaboration.

## Future Enhancements

Based on user feedback, future versions may include:
- Additional data layers for the Geoscope.
- More complex simulations with multiple parameters.
- Enhanced community features like forums or leaderboards.
- Integration with external data sources for real-time updates.
