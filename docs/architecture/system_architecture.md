## 📋 Introduction

This document describes the technical architecture of Synergy Sphere, a climate solutions collaboration platform. The system is built as a full-stack web application with real-time capabilities and interactive visualization features.

---

## 🎯 System Overview

Synergy Sphere is architected as a modern web application with the following key characteristics:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: React-based frontend with Express.js backend
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket support for live collaboration
- **Data-Driven Visualizations**: Interactive charts and 3D globe visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive UI components

### Key Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript | User interface and interactions |
| Backend | Express.js + TypeScript | API services and business logic |
| Database | SQLite (via Drizzle ORM) | Data persistence |
| UI Framework | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Styling and component library |
| Visualization | Three.js + Recharts | 3D globe and data charts |

## 🔧 Component Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

```
client/src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/             # Base UI components (shadcn/ui)
│   ├── Navigation.tsx  # Main navigation component
│   ├── Globe3D.tsx     # 3D globe visualization
│   └── Community.tsx   # Community features
├── pages/              # Page components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
└── lib/                # Utility functions and configs
```

### Backend Architecture

```
server/
├── index.ts           # Application entry point
├── routes.ts          # API route definitions
├── storage.ts         # Database operations
└── vite.ts           # Development server integration
```

### Shared Architecture

```

## 💻 Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system

### Key Libraries

- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives via shadcn/ui
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js for globe visualization
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **State Management**: React Query for server state
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based authentication
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side routing

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials via Auth page
2. Backend validates credentials and generates JWT
3. Frontend stores token and updates auth state
4. Protected routes check authentication status

### Solution Sharing Flow

1. User creates solution via dashboard
2. Frontend validates input and sends to API
3. Backend stores solution with generated shareable link
4. Real-time updates notify community members
5. Solutions appear in community feed with interaction capabilities

### Climate Data Visualization

1. Backend fetches climate data from configured sources
2. Data is processed and cached for visualization
3. Frontend requests data via API endpoints
4. Interactive charts and globe display climate metrics
5. User interactions trigger data filtering and updates

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Architecture Choices

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Monorepo Structure** | Simplified development and deployment with shared types |
| **TypeScript Throughout** | Type safety and better developer experience |
| **SQLite Database** | Lightweight, serverless, perfect for MVP and development |
| **Component Library** | Consistent UI with shadcn/ui for professional appearance |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first approach for rapid UI development |

### Performance Considerations

- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of page components
- **Optimized Bundling**: Vite for fast builds and HMR
- **Efficient Queries**: Drizzle ORM with prepared statements
- **Asset Optimization**: Optimized images and fonts
- **Caching Strategy**: Browser caching for static assets

### Security Measures

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin request handling
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
